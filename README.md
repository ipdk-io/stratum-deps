# Stratum Dependencies

Stratum is the component of `infrap4d` that implements the P4Runtime and gNMI
(OpenConfig) services.

This repository allows you to build and install various third-party libraries
required by Stratum.

It is intended to supersede the `setup` directory in `networking-recipe`.

The repository is functional, but it is still a work in progress.
